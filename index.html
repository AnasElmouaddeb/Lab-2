	<h1>JavaScript</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
			JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
			The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
			JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
			Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

		<h2>History</h2>
			<p>JavaScript is everywhere, and for the seventh year in a row, it has been ranked the most commonly used programming language, with 67.8% of developers employing it in 2019. Its ascent to the world’s most popular programming language is synonymous with the rise of the internet itself.
			Created out of necessity, it is used to build 95.2% (1.52 billion) of websites today, including some of the world’s largest, like Facebook and YouTube. Without it, we would not have popular and useful web apps such as Google Maps and eBay. 
			So, without further ado, let’s take a look at what JavaScript is,  how and why it was created, and what’s next for the language.
			What Is JavaScript?
			JavaScript is a scripting language that is one of the three core languages used to develop websites. Whereas HTML and CSS give a website structure and style, JavaScript lets you add functionality and behaviors to your website, allowing your website’s visitors to interact with content in many imaginative ways.
			JavaScript is primarily a client-side language, meaning it runs on your computer within your browser. However, more recently the introduction of Node.js has allowed JavaScript to also execute code on servers.
			Since its release, JavaScript has surpassed Java, Flash, and other languages because it is relatively easy to learn, has a free and open community, and, most importantly, is incredibly useful, allowing developers to quickly create apps with audiences in the millions.
